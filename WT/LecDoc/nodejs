Node
paradime will be changed what we have studied everything yet

what is node -

where has ur javascript run 
 browser makes req to server (doing web based application)
 in server we have html page the page is interpred by interpretor
 javascript or jquery code inside htmlwhen the html send back response 
 browser interpreter 
 on browser side we have javascript engine whenever there is 
 javascript coide coime to me 
 javascript is mainly for clind side manupulation ,eventy handling, client side validation , diom 
 manipulation 
 scripting langyuage runs onluy in host encvirrinmwent , encvirrinmwent provided by bbrowser
  
  whart if i told u javascript code that could execute at server soiode 
  
  
  node js is platform 
  os>install node >
  
  node is running on top of underlying os it is a javatype paltform node by itself will not do anything by himself
  javascript can be run on server side 
  creatinmg an ordinary js file 
  os>node(powerful javascript engine v8 roll roys of digital world)>js
  every browser runs a javascript engine 
  chrome v8
  mozzila spider monkey
  micro soift edge chakra 
  sadfari nitro
  javascript code and store it in .js file 
  now we need to execute tghis stabnd alone ,it has to run  on host env
  node is nothing but javascript runtimre platform 
  
  in java 
  os>jvm>.java> compile and execute <runs on jvm> similarly in js and node
  
  node is like jvm 
  node allows to execute .js code
  angular and react are to similar client side frameworks and angular written in type scriptingconverted into javascript
  angular is framework used for creating front end application 
  and node is a platform for running .js code  it is at backend
  
  
  Understanding Node
  Basics of Node
  node running top of my os
  node js can execute any .js code /javascriptcode
  using node liubrary we can create ordinary js file 
  and setup a complete web server

Webservers TOmcat,Weblogic,iis(dotnet)....

setting up server  
-download the server-install the server
nodejs runtim,e gives class 
setting webserver at node side 
bring in few htm,l pages in webserver 
so server between nodejs and .js 


web server running on nodejs


so lets here is TOmcat an ordinary web server 

choose your book > submit> data on serverside
>server side code > broser says this category and all filkter that i want
> server side code hit database fetch data massage the data put in html format ams then send data back to browser
server side cpode executing if php then apache inside script php , dotnet

on ur poath to become ful stack developer not only workiung on only front or end whole front and end tech 
all kind of tech 
asp.net vb.net  ..........
so much technologies for being a full stack dewveloper 
if i use node on mmy webserver has no. of htnl pages the broewesr makes req 
hit server from browserr and some serverside code must execute server side code is written in javascriptthis can use nosql databses
mongo and all,
process req hit databses retrieve data send info back as pure html respose 
learn javascript once and use it on server as wella s client sid edgelear
learn javascript for various applications
expressjs runs top of nodejs 
expressjs amkes easy to craete web based application
node alone does not make much sense 
Mean Stack 
-mongo-express-angular-nodejs

JAVASCRIPT IS VIMP

ordinary webserver as tomcat created spring boot application 
based on java (chervolate jsp learn) 
create restful webapplication will expose its functionallity in form of api 

on client i can create angular/react application single page app made of various componants 
ajax klike some componebts are only affected 
jasoon data sent in json format at backlednd spring boot
massage json data to display on ur html page 

at backend well be only creating backend componenets as spring boot and all
at large organisation they are used a minute part of spring boot 

LETS move on to node
to handle req made from browser 
there are threads created naming thread pouyll 
when a req r1 comes it will go to thread pool it will take a thread and handle these req
when all thereads are exhausted (idealy never exhaust)
renewable threads 
waiting time when all thread  are busy or unavailable may be there which wil;l be irritating 
lets see how node handles same thing 
-single thread handles all req

%%%%single threaded modelling in Node 

in traditional programming the i/o is performed in same way  

printf ()
.
. 
function()
.
.

synchronous programming -traditonal programming

Quer against database is going on thread sits ideal -blocking
  
  Asynchronous processeiing / event driven progtramming
 
traditional
 result=query(select* from empl );
  do something with result(result);
  cant do anything till result is not ready
  
  
  
  query_finished=function(result){
  do something with result(result);
  }
query("select * from empl;" query finished );
