multiople elkemnts p[alced next to one onother on a sdingle row

.form-control this will make it full width element
<div class="form-group"> class form-group around each
form control margin 
vvimp 
 
 verticle direct direct 
 horizontal tricky 
 <div class="form-group row">
 <lable for="mail" class="col-sm-2" col-form-lable>Email</lable>
 <div class="col-sm-10"> it will ocuppy entire 10 cols 
 on decreasing width of page the form becomes verticle
 
 -Inline Form
