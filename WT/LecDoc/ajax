parts on webpage server will updsate some part of web page not
whole page term partial screen update part of webpage are computed and 
updated 
ajax is asynchronous and above thing
first time full web page is sent 
one part busy rest is kept on static for user 
ajax will be used on some part of application 
ex. user sighn up form 
-provide username on tabbing out that input form will send u 
alert that this username is already taken for ex ajax does this (partial screenupdate)
 photo uploaded on webpage partial part update on whole web page 
 google suggest an examplke of ajax 
 gmail uses ajax,maps use ajax 
 go myntra.com ->choose  indianware -> list of cloths-> filter
 udating on basis of filtercan we say that ajax is dependent on time variable where 
  computing is done on regards with previous entry
  so rather than doing inserting ajax does update anchoring on request
  
  AJAX 
  natural user interation 
  ajax is technology which gives output as display before computing 
  the actual output to keep user interacted ? right
  laxmi shop , interation , bring clothes. servent go retreave cloths , continous conversation 
  is happening
  servent is ajax 
  
  name of ajax obj xmlhttprequest "xhr" this is javascript objso it ll expose properties and methods
  methods
  -open()
  -send()
  
  properties
  -onreadychange
  -state 
  -readystate
  -responseText
  -responseXML
  
  XMH methods___>>>
  open takes 2/3 argument 
  fist argument as http methods (get/post/put/delete/trace) as a request 
  to back end
  -----------------
  So Ajax is part of front end but converses with back end correct?
----kshitij-----------
hmm correct kshitij-----------

from browser request for get  
fetch me contents after going to my.php
make connection with my.php
i ll get the data back from server

<script>
//mozill,safari
var xhr= new XMLHTTPRequest();// how to get xhr obj from browse

xhr.open("GET","http://someserver.com/myapp/my.php?t1=aaa&t2=bbb"); ---establish connection
//actual request
xmh.send(null);--- to send request actually

xhr.open("POST","http://someserver.com/myapp/my.php?t1=aaa&t2=bbb"); ---establish connection
//actual request
xhr.setRequestHeader("content-type",app....)
xmh.send(body);


xhr.onreadystatechange = functrion (){
if(xhr.readystate==4)//they have var like 1,2,3,4 depending on state
if(xhr.readystate==200)-- sucess
then  to capture response
xhr.responsexml holding response for u keep me in ur var
var xmlres=xhr.responsexml;
if server give response and u want to take it 
in json format and it keep it in ur var
var obj = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText); //parse
console.lg(obj.username);


}; //callback function

 
</script>
function gets callled automatically 
callback function are function which are called 
 after completion of task
 
result of response from server ->

  HML
  JSON
  plain text
  
  ajax will work connection with diff technology 
  ideally calling it AJAJ
  
  open - establishes a connection from js code to code on server side
  intent to mkake req to my.php running on some server
  xhtr.open(http-method,url)
  
  milk boiling no need to stand asiusde it 
  we ll wait for signal like smell or something
  this task is done asynchronous 
  the signal is callback (on ready state change)
  
  mam what is frequency of updation of readystate current status of req 
  on time scale in sec/msec
  every http response have 3 parts
  
  
  -status
  -response header
  -response body
  
  |  |  --response--     |  | 
  |  |                   |  | 
  |  |                   |  | 
  
  responsexml is in form of xml response
  
  bringing together 
  functiong getdate()
  {
  
  xhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
  
  if(xttp)
  xhr.open("GET","http://someserver.com/myapp/my.php?t1=aaa&t2=bbb"); ---establish connection
  //actual request
  xmh.send(null);
  
  xhttp.onreadychange=function(){
  if(xhr.readystate==4&& xhr.status==200){
  document.getElementByid("ibresult").innerHTML=xhr.responseTExt;
  }
  }
  
  1]xhr.onreadystatechange=function(){}
 2]xhr.readystate = x(0 to 4)
 3]xhr.status = 1xx/2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx
 4]xhr.responseText ---responseXML property is a read-only value 
 which returns a Document containing the HTML or XML retrieved by 
 the request, or null if the request was unsuccessful, has not yet 
 been sent, or if the retrieved data can't be correctly parsed as
 XML or HTML.
