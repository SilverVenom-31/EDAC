THIRD PARTY MODULES
------------------------------------------------------
so popular the node, many developers have uploaded codes 
thrd party modules using NPM
on top of node js we will istall expressjs and swiftly create web applications 
expressjs is third party module 
ex create brilliant app export expressjs 
ex expressjs working with cookies , want to able to handle cookies 
expressjs dont k now  so we need to install third party module 
as cookieparser on top of expressjs which will handle cookie 
node application need to sttopre data in mongo data bas e 
i need to install mongoDBmodule databse as third party module 
--------------------------------------
any packages can be uploaded on nodejs.org
execute node js
NPM - node package manager 
preinstalled with nodejs
npm does every thing for me like installing expressjs
- npm install Express
alternative 
npm/yarn
350000 packages 
to verify npm installation npm -v
install packages ------------------
globally - only when ti install development tool or cli packages otherwise 
most of thre installation should be done locally
global for angular cli
>npm install @AngularCLI -g Typescript --for development tools 
>npm install -g Typescript

express should be installed kloacally as we are not using it for 20-30% 
local 
> npm install --save cookie-parser 
>npm install bootstrap@4.1.1

when intalled these packages it ll get stored in node_module
