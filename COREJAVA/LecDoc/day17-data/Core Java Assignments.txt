Day 17
1. Create a Student class  with following			
studentId(int),course(string),name,marks,birthDate(LocalDate)			//check
2. Create a Tester to store Student details in a suitable HashSet
Add 5 student details ( 4 with different ids & 5th with existing)			//check
2.1 What will happen, if equals n hashCode is not overridden?
Will it detect dups ?
2.2 What will happen, if only equals is  overridden?
Will it detect dups ?
Why ? 
2.3 What will happen, if  equals  n hashCode is  overridden? (BUT only mandary part of the contract)
Equal objects producing SAME hashcode
Will it detect dups ?
What about performance ?
2.3 What will happen, if  equals  n hashCode is  overridden? (With mandary n optional part of the contract)
Equal objects producing SAME hashcode & un equal ocjects producing DISTINCT hashcodes.
Will it detect dups ?
What about performance ? 

2.4 Copy this project into another project n make the changes.
PK : student id , course & dob
How will you solve it to detect dups & manage constant performance?
